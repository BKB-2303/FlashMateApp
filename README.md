Hi, My name is Bikash Borah.I developed a mobile application called FlashMate using Flutter. The app's amazing feature is the ability for users to set a custom interval for the flashlight to turn on and off. Users can select the interval duration, the number of times the light should flash, and the total duration of the flashing sequence according to their preferences.
